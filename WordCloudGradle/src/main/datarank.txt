“Climate change is certainly going to destabilise situations,” General Ron Keys, retired leader of the air force command, told a seminar at the Wilson Centre think-tank on Wednesday. “There are some countries out there that are just hanging on by their fingernails.”

Generals also fear a rise in deployments dealing with natural disasters – which would play a strain on resources and could potentially leave the US exposed.

“The real problem is what do we do if we are involved in a Fukushima or a hurricane Sandy times three and somebody like Isis decides to make a big push,” Keys said. “If I were a bad guy I’d wait until the US was involved in a big situation and then I would make my move.”
